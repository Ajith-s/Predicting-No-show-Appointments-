# Predicting-No-show-Appointments-
Predicting whether or not patients show up for their appointment based on various parameters. This kaggle data-set collects information from 100 k medical appointments in Brazil.

A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.
● ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
● ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.
● ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.
● Be careful about the encoding of the last column: it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.
